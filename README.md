## Introduction
Wether it is a Microcontrollers, FPGAs or some ASIC they all have one thing in common and tha is GPIO. GPIO stands for General Purpose Input Output. As the name suggest it can be used as both input and output depending on the state of control signals. GPIO is usually a subpart of a large systems, primarily used for getting data from physical word or external devices or giving command to external devices. This repository is offers a GPIO design which works on 0.9V core and 3.3 I/O logic level. All the communication or control signal logic is base on 0.9V design and the I/O functionality of GPIO operates at 3.3V logic.
